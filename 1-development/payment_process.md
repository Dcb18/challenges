##InvoiceXpress Challenge UI/UX

Hi there! This challenge contains the description of a problem that has come up while working at InvoiceXpress.

This is the last phase our recruiting process. To do this, we would like to challenge you to collaborate with us on solving a problem that we've encountered before.

This is not an exam, so there are no right or wrong solutions. Itâ€™s just a way for us to work together solving a problem. This way, you also get an idea of the type of things we do at InvoiceXpress.

With this challenge we want to see your working style, how you solve problems and how you communicate. We also expect you to understand how we work as a team and the types of problems we usually have to deal with.

###Next Steps

1. Read the problem.
2. Visit our website (invoicexpress.com) and create an account.
3. You can use the HipChat channel to discuss the problem at hand or for asking questions.
4. Solve the problem any way you like, but do the best you can. This means you can use any tools.
5. After you finished we want a demo, at our office, with your process and solution. You can use any resources existing in our office (printer/ tv/ flipchart, etc).
6. The challenge should be delivered until April 4th. You have one week to work in your solution.
7. Have fun!

###The Problem
InvoiceXpress has free trial accounts for users to experiment our app and see how simple it is.

After 30 days users need to choose:
* The best plan to fit their need: (small / medium / big)
* Payment duration: (monthly / annually / bi-annually)
* Payment Type: ( MB (Multibanco) / Paypal / Credit card / Bank account transfer)
 
For this challenge we want you to work on the interface for better usability and scalability for each payment type, from the beginning of the buying process till the conclusion of it.

User Stories:
* As a user, I want to be able to see all available options for my first payment.
* As a user, I want to be able to choose the subscription/payment duration.
* As a user, I want to be able to select any payment type that suits my need/desire.
* As a paying (non-trial) user, I want to be able to change my plan (upgrade or downgrade). By default all trial accounts start at our most complete (expensive) plan, giving the user access to all features.

###Interface Considerations

Please present us with the process and methodology you would follow to solve this challenge. You may want to consider some deliverables like: task-flow analysis diagrams, journey maps/experience maps, Heuristic analysis, interactive rapid prototypes, visual translation (hi-fidelity mockups).

Final note: If there's anything you don't understand or is ambiguous, talk with us in the HipChat room we created for you ;)
